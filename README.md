  ## Description 
  In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

  
  ## REQUIRED
  The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.
The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:


name


id


email


getName()


getId()


getEmail()


getRole()—returns 'Employee'


The other three classes will extend Employee.
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:


officeNumber


getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'


In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following:


github—GitHub username


getGithub()


getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'


In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:


school


getSchool()


getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'
